I don't have a reasonable way to validate data.
This is just for practice and for my own interest. 
Exact accuracy is not critical for my purposes.
Trusting data will be accurate enough for entertainment and practice.

Of the data that is availalbe and provided below I marked and selected those I am intersted in, marked y (for yes intersted).
I will be renaming the columns to easier to understand at a glance headers. 
Full column detail will always be available here.
